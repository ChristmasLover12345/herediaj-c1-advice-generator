 // Advice Generator in React

 // made a simple card that when clicked gives you advice from an API

 note: on the assignment description it says to use all assets given, but none of the examples seem to use the favicon.png, so I didnt use it.

// The generator works as intended, and the page looks good! If anything the responsiveness when it shrinks to small sizes (< 400px) could be a bit better? Like it feels to squished in the screen at smaller sizes, but otherwise looks pretty good
## i see what he means but I cant really fix the problem without making the divider look weird.
